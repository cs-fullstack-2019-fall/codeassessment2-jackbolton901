# ### Problem 5
# Create a SportsTeam Class for tracking sports teams. The class should have the properties team_name_p, team_city, and team_ranking_p.
# The class should have a method to change a Teamâ€™s ranking. 
# The class should implement the ```__str__``` method so that when an instance of the SportsTeam is printed it will output a string containing the team name, team city, and team rank (use f strings to format the output).
# Your program should create a SportsTeam instance with an initial ranking of 2.
# Print out the class.
# Your program should change the ranking of the team to 8 using only the class method.
# Print out the class (should use your ```__str__``` method).

# creating the class
class SportsTeam:
    def __init__(self, team_name, team_city, team_ranking):
        self.team_name = team_name
        self.team_city = team_city
        self.team_ranking = team_ranking
# rank changing method
    def changeRank(self):
        newRank = input('change the ranking to: ')
        self.team_ranking = newRank
        return newRank
 # making the default string
    def __str__(self):
        myStr = f'The {self.team_name} are from {self.team_city} and they are ranked {self.team_ranking}'
        return myStr
    # new instance
windy = SportsTeam('Bulls', 'Chicago', '2')

print(windy)
windy.changeRank()
print(windy)

# Example Output:
# ```
# The Grizzlies are from Memphis and are 2 in the standings.
# # Update the rating from 2 to 8 from your code
# The Grizzlies are from Memphis and are 8 in the standings.
# ```
